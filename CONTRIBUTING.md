## How to Contribute

Before starting your work, make sure to drop a comment on the issue you wish to work on so that we can assign it to you. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub
2. Clone the project to your own machine
3. Commit changes to your own branch
4. Push your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes
5. Once you feel you have completed the sub-tasks specified in the issue, take a screenshot of the component you created or edited and upload it in the comments section of the issue along with the list of new files that you created and the pre-existing ones you modified

### All the changes should be pushed to the development branch.
