## How to Contribute

Before starting your work, make sure to drop a comment on the issue you wish to work on so that we can assign it to you. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub
2. Clone the project to your own machine from the development branch (The development branch will always be updated first)
3. Commit changes to your own branch
4. Push your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes
5. Once you feel you have completed the sub-tasks specified in the issue, take a screenshot of the component you created or edited and upload it in the comments section of the issue along with the list of new files that you created and the pre-existing ones you modified

### **All the changes should be pushed to the development branch.**

## File Structure

Having a proper and efficient file structure is very important while working on a project with multiple editors. It is imperative that you adhere to the following layout whenever you add a new file to this project.

**Components folder :** contains all components and their css (if necessary)

**Assets/Images folder :** contains images

**Pages folder :** contains separate page components and their respective css in corresponding directories. The pages are exported using the ```index.jsx``` file.

All files returning a component should have a ```.jsx``` extension rather than a ```.js``` extension

In case you encounter any difficulties while working on an issue, feel free to reach out to us or your peers for assistance.
